3. Gable areas included in wall calculations as triangular additions
4. 10% waste factor applied to all field materials

## VERIFICATION NEEDED

- [ ] Confirm actual roof dimensions from roof plan
- [ ] Verify window rough opening sizes vs. finish frame sizes
- [ ] Check if any walls are non-sided (brick, stone, etc.)
- [ ] Confirm gutter locations with drainage plan
- [ ] Verify soffit is open vs. closed design
