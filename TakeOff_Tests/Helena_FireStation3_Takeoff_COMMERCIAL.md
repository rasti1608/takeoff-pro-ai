# SECTION 7: NOTES & CLARIFICATIONS

## Assumptions Made

1. **Wall heights** derived from elevation datum points on sections (First Floor = 100'-0")
2. **Storefront areas** estimated from elevation views; verify with window schedule submittals
3. **Hose tower dimensions** estimated at 17'×17' based on floor plan grid spacing
4. **Waste factors NOT included** - add per standard practice:
   - Brick: 5-10%
   - Metal panels: 10-15%
   - Wood siding: 15%

## Items Requiring Field Verification

- [ ] Exact storefront/curtainwall dimensions (coordinate with manufacturer)
- [ ] Decorative metal panel cutout pattern (verify with architect)
- [ ] Brick color/pattern match to Marquee Sign
- [ ] ZIP sheathing system compatibility with all cladding attachments
- [ ] Hidden gutter dimensions at apparatus bay

## Excluded from This Takeoff

- Interior finishes (see Sheet A3-3 Finish Schedule)
- Mechanical/electrical penetrations
- Site work (fencing, monuments, flagpole)
- Foundation waterproofing
- Paint/coatings (except as noted)
